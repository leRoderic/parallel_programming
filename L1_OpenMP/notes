PART 1:
-- original makefile: 10650133us
-- Code creates an GRB array, where every 1/3 of its height

PART 2:
-> These flags are for optimization and offer different levels of peformance improvement.
-> Some of these optimizations rely on undefined behaviour, and when exposed to a code that has not been fully tested, can introduce bugs. Also -Ofast enables optimizations that are not valid for all standard compliant programs, so extra care must be taken.
-> Execution times with flags:
---- with -O flag: 6262940us
---- with -O2 flag: 6383179us
---- with -O3 flag: 805382us
---- with -Ofast flag: 810291us
-> COMPARISON (Original vs -Ofast):
---- ORIGINAL: 10650133us
---- OPTIMIZ.:   810291us
   -92.39% over the non optimized code
-> (-Ofast) enables all -O3 optimizations as well as another ones that aren't IEEE compliant such as -ffast-math (which changes x=x*x*x*x; for x*=x;x*=x), -fno-rounding-math (uses default rounding mode) and -fallow-store-data-races (the name says it all) among others.
